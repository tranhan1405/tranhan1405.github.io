**Abstract**: The novel S-CN (Samsung Connection Nodes) connection system, featuring nodes crafted from 3D-printed sand molds and integrated with vertical and horizontal components paired with rectangular hollow section (RHS) members, provides an effective method for connecting modules in steel modular buildings. This study employs experimental and numerical methods to assess the axial compression and tensile capacities of vertical connections, as well as the shear capacities of horizontal connections. Results show that the vertical connection’s axial capacity is significantly influenced by the thickness of the roof node’s top plate. While the reduction in area due to the roof node’s openings affects compression performance, it has minimal impact on tensile performance. Similarly, the shear capacities of horizontal connections depend on the capacities of their shear pins. The parametric study reveals that increasing the thickness of the roof node’s top plate leads to a linear increase in both the ultimate tensile and compression loads of the vertical connections. Additionally, increasing the diameter of the shear pins results in a modest increase in the ultimate shear load of the horizontal connections.
