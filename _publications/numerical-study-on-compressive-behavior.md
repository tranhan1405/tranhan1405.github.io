**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel approach for steel modular structures, incorporating the S-CN connector – a hybrid tie rod and connector connection method – along with rectangular hollow section (RHS) steel members. The study numerically investigates the mechanical behavior of S-CN connectors and their application in beam–column connections under compressive loading. The compressive load-bearing capacity of the proposed connection is determined following AISC 360-16 guidelines, predicted through a finite element analysis approach and validated by experimental data. Parametric analysis reveals the impact of local buckling in modular nodes on the connector’s load-bearing capacity. The results demonstrate that tie plate thickness has a minimal effect, while reducing the modular node thickness leads to a linear decrease in load capacities. Furthermore, the failure mode of the beam–column connection depends on the compressive capacities of both the RHS column and the S-CN connector.
