**Abstract**: The most problematic noise in apartment buildings is structure-borne sound, which is created when an impact causes the floor to vibrate and radiate sound. Until now, several studies focus on developing multiple layers of resilient materials are used to construct floating floors in order to absorb impact and minimize structure-borne noise. This study proposes a novel floating floor with rubber cushions for reducing floor impact noises. Experiments using a mockup of the proposed floating floors subjected to heavy impact loading were conducted on floor configurations with various rubber cushion shapes. Furthermore, a numerical analysis was carried out and verified by experimental data. According to the experimental and analytical results, increasing the height of the rubber cushions and adding a layer of lightweight concrete lowers the heavy-weight floor impact sound and improve acoustic performance for conventional concrete floor systems.
