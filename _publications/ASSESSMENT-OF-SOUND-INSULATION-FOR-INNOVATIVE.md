**Abstract**: This study examines the acoustic performance of a novel thermal break featuring Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) cores and thermal insulation layers, aimed at reducing heat loss at building wall junctions. By adjusting the thicknesses of expanded polystyrene (EPS), cellulose fiber reinforced cement board (CRC), and Melamine foam, it identifies optimal configurations for enhanced sound insulation. Key findings from the tests suggest that reducing the thickness of EPS while incorporating thicker CRC layers, and increasing the thickness of Melamine foam, significantly improves the sound insulation performance. Additionally, a numerical analysis was conducted and validated by experimental data, emphasizing the critical impact of material selection on the sound insulation efficacy of the novel thermal break..
