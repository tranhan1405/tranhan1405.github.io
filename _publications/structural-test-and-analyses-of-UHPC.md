**Abstract**: In residential buildings, the connection between the wall and the slab is the most important area for the design to prevent structural failure and heat loss. The research objective is to evaluate the load capacity of connecting shear keys to an existing slab and panel concrete (PC) wall structure, as well as to develop a design for this connection under direct shear and bending. The experimental program included four test specimens, two of which had one shear key and two shear keys for the others for each loading condition. The test results demonstrate that the structural bearing capacity of bending and shear are significantly improved by changes to the dimensions of the slab, the design of the shear key, and the number of ribs, with the ultimate load increased by 54.45% and 56.85%, respectively. In addition, a finite element (FE) model was used to numerically simulate the behavior of all specimens. The crack and load–displacement curves of the numerical simulations were validated against experimental results using the LS-DYNA program, and good agreement was observed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the numerical model for simulating the behavior of the system components. Several critical input parameters, a constitutive model, and a bar–concrete interface are recommended. The experiments and simulations highlight the effectiveness of various technical solutions for boosting the load capacity of the structure.
