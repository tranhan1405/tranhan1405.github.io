**Abstract**: The seismic performance of lighting systems is rarely reported in the literature, although previous studies indicate that they could be vulnerable during an earthquake. This study investigated the effect of various connectors on the seismic performance of an innovative wireway vibration attenuation system for raceway light fixtures using shaking table tests based on the ICC-ES AC156 standard. The floor spectrum was created, and its compatible floor motion time history was employed as the input motion. Four typical prototypes were prepared with connectors suitable for mounting on a variety of structural components, including ceiling, H-beam frame, wall, and beam-column. The test results demonstrated that the specimens with the direct connectors (wall and H-beam frame) had excellent seismic performance, 1.4â€“2.0 times higher than those with the pole connectors (ceiling and beam-column). Therefore, the direct connectors are proposed for this innovative system to decrease the risk of system failure during an earthquake.
