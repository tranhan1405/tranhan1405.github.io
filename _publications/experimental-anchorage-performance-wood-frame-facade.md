**Abstract:**  
This paper presents an experimental and analytical investigation of a newly developed fastening system for wood-frame façades. The study aims to evaluate the anchorage performance under both tensile and shear loads through laboratory tests and analytical modeling. Full-scale specimens were tested to assess load–displacement behavior, failure modes, and ultimate strength. Analytical models were developed to predict the mechanical behavior of the connections and validated using the experimental results. The findings demonstrate a good agreement between analytical predictions and experimental data, confirming the reliability of the proposed fastening system for wood-frame façade applications.
