**Abstract:**  
This study presents an experimental and analytical investigation of a newly developed fastening system for wood-frame façades. The anchorage performance was evaluated through laboratory tests on full-scale specimens under tensile and shear loading conditions. Analytical models were then developed to predict the load-bearing capacity and failure mechanisms of the connections. The comparison between experimental and analytical results demonstrated good agreement, confirming the accuracy of the proposed models. The findings contribute to the improvement of façade fastening systems and provide guidance for design optimization and safety assessment of wood-frame structures.
