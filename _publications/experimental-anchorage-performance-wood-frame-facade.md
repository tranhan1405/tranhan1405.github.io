**Abstract:**  
This paper presents an experimental and analytical investigation of a newly developed fastening system for wood-frame façades. The study aims to evaluate the anchorage performance under both tensile and shear loads through laboratory tests and analytical modeling. Full-scale specimens were tested to assess the load–displacement behavior, failure modes, and ultimate strength. Analytical models were then developed to predict the mechanical behavior of the connections and validated using experimental data. The results show strong agreement between experimental and analytical outcomes, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the fastening system in ensuring structural safety and façade integrity.
