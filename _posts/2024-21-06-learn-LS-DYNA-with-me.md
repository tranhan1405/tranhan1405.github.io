The provided images contain a detailed explanation of the concept of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Here’s a summary of the key points:

### Concept of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) [1]

1. **Definition and Purpose**:
   - FEA is a computational technique introduced by Turner et al. in 1956.
   - It provides approximate solutions to engineering problems with complex domains and boundary conditions.
   - FEA is essential in modeling physical phenomena in various engineering disciplines, such as solids, liquids, and gases.

2. **Field Variables**:
   - The field variables in FEA vary from point to point within a domain (a continuum with a known boundary).

3. **Decomposition and Meshing**:
   - FEA divides the domain into a finite number of subdomains or elements.
   - This division process is called meshing or discretization.
   - Systematic approximate solutions are constructed using variational or weighted residual methods.

4. **Elements and Nodes**:
   - The unknown field variable is expressed in terms of approximating functions within each element.
   - These functions, or interpolation functions, are defined based on field variables at specific points called nodes.
   - Nodes are typically located along the element boundaries, connecting adjacent elements.

5. **Process Steps**:
   - Discretization of the domain into subdomains (elements).
   - Selection of interpolation functions.
   - Development of the element matrix for each subdomain.
   - Assembly of the element matrices to form the global matrix.
   - Imposition of boundary conditions.
   - Solution of equations.
   - Additional computations if necessary.

6. **Solution Approaches**:
   - **Direct Approach**: Used for relatively simple problems, often to explain FEA concepts.
   - **Weighted Residuals**: A versatile method suitable for various problems, utilizing governing differential equations.
   - **Variational Approach**: Based on the calculus of variations, used for problems involving functional extremization, such as potential energy in structural mechanics.

7. **Global System of Equations**:
   - In matrix notation, the global system of equations is represented as \( Ku = F \).
   - \( K \) is the system stiffness matrix, \( u \) is the vector of unknowns, and \( F \) is the force vector.
   - \( K \) and \( F \) may depend on the nature of the problem and time.
