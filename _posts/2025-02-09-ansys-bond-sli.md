The **SOLID65** element in **ANSYS Workbench** is designed to model concrete behavior, particularly to simulate cracking due to tensile stresses. This process involves defining material properties for both the concrete and the embedded rebar while ensuring appropriate contact and interaction between them.

To capture the **bond-slip behavior** between the rebar and concrete, **COMBINE39** elements are employed. These elements represent a non-linear spring behavior that accurately simulates how bond strength evolves and slip occurs as the applied load increases.
